In this assignment, you will read through the class wiki and answer the
questions given below.

## Setup

  Make sure that you are on the `master` branch of your `wdi-remote-matey` repo.
  Then run `git pull upstream master` to pull the latest materials from the
  instructors' repository. You shouldn't hit a merge conflict here, but if you
  do, flag down an instructor right away.

  Next, navigate to the directory for today, and go into the `homework`
  directory.

## Questions

Please do not use any resource other than the class wiki to answer these
questions.

    by one of GA's senior instructors?
3.  What book by Douglas Crockford is on our recommended reading list?
4.  According to our Git style guide, when writing the detailed description of
    a commit in its commit message, what three types of things are most
    important to mention?
5.  What does a bug report in the bug journal need to have before it can be
    submitted?
6.  There are three Git tutorials referenced in the Wiki. What are they?
7.  List at least two basic style guidelines that will help your projects look
    clean.
8.  What is the maximum number of absences a student can have, and how many
    'tardies' are equal to an absence?
9.  Where might you find a list of publicly accessible APIs?
10. What two holidays will we have during this course (not counting the long
    winter break)?
